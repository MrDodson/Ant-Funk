     TODO: 
     
     - Ammend RegExp to handle trace statements that are not
       terminated with a semi-colon.
     - Fix terminating early if semi-colon within a trace
       statement. ? Try s/trace\(.*\);?//gi (without a ? on 
       the .*? it'll keep eating 'til it's full) as shown by
       http://twitter.com/pollensoft

     This script is based on code written by:
